An XY plotter capable of creating user-generated lego scenes

TODO:
Read .ldr file and get the position and type of each block


Computer side: 
- GUI for building lego scenes, or just use leocad
- Read files, maybe LDraw or the user generated file, and create path code
- Get subroutines coded (pick up part, take away part, etc.)
- Know location of bin for each piece color
- Loading system of parts onto belt before running
- Pick up piece (magnetically) from large bin of parts. Need way to orient parts (magnet at base of bin?) Hall effect sensor or camera to tell if it's picked up?
